1. **Revenue**:  
   - Total revenue realized is **1.69 billion** with a week-over-week growth rate of **0.002**.
   - Revenue is broken down by categories such as luxury and business, where **61.62%** of the revenue comes from the business category, 
     and **38.38%** from the luxury category.

2. **RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)**:  
   - The RevPAR stands at **7,337**, indicating the revenue generated per available room. This metric helps in understanding the revenue
     efficiency of the available rooms, regardless of their occupancy status.

3. **DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights)**:  
   - The DSRN metric is **2,528**, which measures the average number of rooms ready to be sold per day over a given period.

4. **Occupancy Rate**:  
   - The overall occupancy rate is **57.79%**, which reflects the proportion of available rooms that were successfully booked over the period.
   - The occupancy rate is higher during weekends (**62.64%**) compared to weekdays (**55.85%**), indicating stronger performance over weekends.

5. **ADR (Average Daily Rate)**:  
   - The ADR is **12.70K**, representing the average revenue earned per occupied room, providing insights into pricing strategies and revenue 
     management effectiveness.

    bookings made.

7. **Booking Platform Analysis**:  
   - Bookings are analyzed by various platforms such as MakeYourTrip, LogTrip, Tripster, etc. Each platform's performance is represented in 
      terms of realization percentage and ADR, with some platforms showing higher ADR but lower realization rates and vice versa.
   
8. **Cancellation and No-show Rates**:  
   - The cancellation rate is **24.84%**, indicating the proportion of bookings that were canceled out of the total bookings.
   - The no-show rate isn't directly specified but can be derived from total bookings minus cancellations and check-outs.

9. **Property Performance Analysis**:  
   - Different properties across cities such as Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Bangalore show varied performance metrics in terms of revenue, RevPAR, 
      occupancy, ADR, realization percentage, cancellation rate, and average rating.
   - The top-performing properties include "Atliq Exotica" in Mumbai and "Atliq City" in Bangalore.

10. **Weekly Trends Analysis**:  
   - The dashboard shows weekly trends (W19 to W31) for key metrics like RevPAR, ADR, and Occupancy %. It appears there are fluctuations in
      these metrics over time, with certain weeks showing higher occupancy and RevPAR than others, reflecting seasonal or event-driven demand changes.

#### Insights and Trends

- **Revenue Insights**: The majority of the revenue is generated from the business category, which could indicate a stronger demand from business 
   travelers. Strategies could focus on enhancing services and packages targeted at this segment to maximize revenue further.
  
- **Occupancy and Pricing Strategy**: The difference in occupancy rates and ADR between weekdays and weekends suggests a varying demand pattern. 
    Hotels could optimize pricing and promotional strategies to boost occupancy during weekdays or maintain higher rates during weekends to 
    maximize ADR.

- **Platform Performance**: The variability in realization percentages and ADR by booking platforms suggests that some platforms are more 
    effective in converting bookings to check-ins than others. Marketing efforts and partnerships could be optimized to favor higher-performing 
    platforms.

- **Property-Level Performance**: The variation in performance metrics among different properties indicates a need for property-specific strategies.
    For instance, properties with lower average ratings or higher cancellation rates may need to improve service quality or implement more flexible 
    booking and cancellation policies.

- **Weekly Trends**: The weekly analysis of key metrics provides insights into how performance fluctuates, which can be crucial for understanding
    the impact of external factors such as holidays, events, or seasonal trends on hotel performance.

#### Recommendations

1. **Targeted Marketing**: Focus marketing efforts on high-performing segments such as business travelers. Develop specific packages and promotions 
                            to attract this segment.

2. **Dynamic Pricing Strategy**: Implement dynamic pricing strategies to optimize room rates based on demand patterns. For example, offer discounts 
                          during low-occupancy weekdays and premium pricing during high-demand weekends.

3. **Improve Customer Experience**: For properties with lower ratings or higher cancellations, focus on improving customer service and satisfaction
                                    to reduce cancellation rates and increase repeat bookings.

4. **Optimize Platform Use**: Analyze and optimize partnerships with booking platforms to ensure higher realization rates and ADRs. Consider 
                              exclusive deals or promotions with top-performing platforms.

5. **Monitor Trends and Adapt**: Continuously monitor weekly performance trends and adjust operational strategies accordingly. Stay agile to 
                                  adapt to demand changes quickly.
